# 11th Hour HackOverflow 4.0

**Team Name**: BRUH

**Team Members**: Shivam Verma, Rithik Bhandari, Anshumaan Singh

**Track Chosen**: Education
<br/>
**Problem Statement**: The main problem our project "11th Hour" solves is of the students. Many students are not able to study for their college examinations due to some prior commitments or simply don't consider college examinations as their topmost priority. For them, we are making this portal so that they can study "at the 11th hour" and hence the name. They will be taught course-specific content so that they can pass the subject with ease. Along with that we often witness students drifting away from studies for petty freelancing jobs, our project also solves the problems of individuals who are willing to freelance by teaching the course/subject to the students for which they would get paid.

**Challenges Faced**: 
* One of the key challenges faced was to decide on a single state management solution from GetX or Provider. 
* Some of the other challenges faced were finding the appropriate assets. 
* Deciding upon a UI design which finally led us to exploring Neumorphic Design.and using it.
